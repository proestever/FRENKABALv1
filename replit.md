6. Paginated results returned to frontend with loading progress
7. Frontend displays wallet overview and token list

### Portfolio Management Flow

1. Authenticated users can create portfolios
2. Portfolios contain multiple wallet addresses with labels
3. Portfolio data aggregates across all included wallets
4. Real-time updates when wallet data changes
5. Portfolio sharing via unique URLs

### Price Data Flow

1. Token prices fetched from multiple sources (Moralis, DexScreener)
2. Intelligent source selection based on token reliability
3. Price data cached with appropriate TTL
4. Fallback mechanisms for price source failures

## External Dependencies
