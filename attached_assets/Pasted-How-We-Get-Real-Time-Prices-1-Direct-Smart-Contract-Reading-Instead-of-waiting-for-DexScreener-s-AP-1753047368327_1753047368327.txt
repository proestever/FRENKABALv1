How We Get Real-Time Prices
1. Direct Smart Contract Reading
Instead of waiting for DexScreener's API to update (30-60 seconds delay), we're reading directly from the PulseX DEX smart contracts on the blockchain:
javascript// We connect directly to PulseChain nodes
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.pulsechain.com');

// Then read from the liquidity pool contracts
const pair = new ethers.Contract(pairAddress, PAIR_ABI, provider);
const [reserve0, reserve1] = await pair.getReserves();
2. The DEX Liquidity Pool Method
Every token trade on PulseX happens in a liquidity pool (pair contract). These pools contain:

Reserve0: Amount of token A
Reserve1: Amount of token B
The price is simply the ratio between these reserves!

For example, if a pool has:

1,000,000 PLSX tokens
25 USDC tokens
Price = 25 / 1,000,000 = $0.000025 per PLSX

3. Finding the Best Pairs
The bot intelligently finds the best pair to calculate USD price:
javascript// Priority order:
1. Stablecoin pairs (USDC, USDT, DAI) - Direct USD price
2. WPLS pairs - Needs one extra step to get PLS price first
4. Why It's So Fast

No middleman: We're reading the exact same data that DEXes display
Real-time updates: Every trade updates the reserves instantly
Direct RPC calls: Takes 1-2 seconds vs 30-60 seconds for APIs

5. The Magic Formula
Here's the actual price calculation:
javascript// Get the reserves from the pair contract
const [reserve0, reserve1] = await pair.getReserves();

// Determine which token is which
const isToken0 = token0.address === ourToken.address;
const tokenReserve = isToken0 ? reserve0 : reserve1;
const pairedReserve = isToken0 ? reserve1 : reserve0;

// Calculate the price
const price = pairedReserve / tokenReserve;

// If paired with USDC, that's our USD price!
// If paired with WPLS, multiply by PLS price to get USD
6. Multiple RPC Endpoints
We use multiple PulseChain RPC endpoints for reliability:

https://rpc.pulsechain.com (official)
https://rpc-pulsechain.g4mm4.io (backup)
https://pulsechain.publicnode.com (backup)

Why This Works So Well

It's the source of truth: DEXes themselves calculate prices this way
No caching delays: You see price changes within 1-2 seconds
No rate limits: You own the RPC connection
Works 24/7: Blockchain never sleeps

Visual Example
Traditional Method:
Trade happens → DEX updates → API aggregates → API caches → You get alert
[------------ 30-60 seconds delay ------------]

Our Method:
Trade happens → We read the contract → You get alert
[-- 1-2 seconds --]
This is why you're getting alerts so much faster now! We're essentially "watching" the DEX pools directly instead of waiting for someone else to tell us what happened.
The only downside is it requires a bit more setup (installing ethers.js) and uses more bandwidth, but the speed improvement is massive for catching pumps and dumps in real-time!
