Is there a way we can take a token pair ie 0xfC64556FAA683e6087F425819C7Ca3C558e13aC1 and extract which 2 tokens made that pair?

Yes, there is a way to extract the two tokens that make up a token pair from a given pair address, such as 0xfC64556FAA683e6087F425819C7Ca3C558e13aC1. This can be done by interacting with the pair contract on the blockchain, as most decentralized exchange (DEX) pair contracts, like those on Uniswap V2, provide functions to retrieve the addresses of the two tokens involved. Below are two practical methods to achieve this: an on-chain approach using direct contract interaction and an off-chain approach using a blockchain explorer.

On-Chain Method: Direct Contract Interaction
If you have access to a blockchain node or a tool like Web3.js, you can directly call the token0() and token1() functions on the pair contract. These functions return the addresses of the two tokens that form the pair. Here’s how to do it:

Set Up a Connection: Connect to the Ethereum network using a provider like Infura or Alchemy.
Access the Pair Contract: Use the pair address (0xfC64556FAA683e6087F425819C7Ca3C558e13aC1) and the contract’s ABI (application binary interface) to interact with it.
Call the Functions: Invoke token0() and token1() to retrieve the token addresses.
Here’s an example using Web3.js:

javascript

Copy
const Web3 = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY');

const pairAddress = '0xfC64556FAA683e6087F425819C7Ca3C558e13aC1';
const pairAbi = [
  {"constant":true,"inputs":[],"name":"token0","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"address"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},
  {"constant":true,"inputs":[],"name":"token1","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"address"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"}
];

const pairContract = new web3.eth.Contract(pairAbi, pairAddress);

async function getTokens() {
  const token0 = await pairContract.methods.token0().call();
  const token1 = await pairContract.methods.token1().call();
  console.log('Token 0:', token0);
  console.log('Token 1:', token1);
}

getTokens();
Running this code will output the addresses of the two tokens that make up the pair. This method requires some coding knowledge and access to a blockchain node, but it’s precise and programmatic.

Off-Chain Method: Using a Blockchain Explorer
If you don’t want to interact with the blockchain directly or lack the tools to do so, you can use a blockchain explorer like Etherscan to find the token addresses manually. Here’s the process:

Visit Etherscan: Go to Etherscan and enter the pair address (0xfC64556FAA683e6087F425819C7Ca3C558e13aC1) in the search bar.
Access Contract Details: Navigate to the "Contract" tab and select the "Read Contract" section.
Read the Functions: Locate the token0 and token1 functions and click to view their outputs. These will display the addresses of the two tokens.
This method is simple, free, and doesn’t require any coding or blockchain access, making it ideal for quick lookups.

Important Notes
Assumption: These methods assume the pair address is from a Uniswap V2-like DEX, where pair contracts include token0() and token1() functions. Most major DEXs (e.g., SushiSwap) follow this standard, but if the pair is from a different protocol (e.g., Uniswap V3), the approach might vary slightly. However, similar functionality is typically available.
Limitations: Reverse-engineering the pair address using the factory contract and token combinations (via CREATE2) is theoretically possible but impractical due to the enormous number of possible token pairs.
Conclusion
The most efficient way to extract the two tokens from the pair address 0xfC64556FAA683e6087F425819C7Ca3C558e13aC1 is to query the pair contract for token0() and token1(). Use the on-chain method if you’re comfortable with coding and need automation, or the off-chain method via Etherscan for a quick, manual solution. Both approaches will give you the token addresses you’re looking for.

nice so then we can find PLP tokens in our wallet, get how much supply exists, find each token in that pair, then derive how much $ in each side we have correct?

Yes, you’re absolutely correct! You can find PLP tokens in your wallet, determine their total supply, identify the tokens in the pair, and calculate the dollar value of each side of the pair. Here’s how you can do it step-by-step:

Step 1: Find PLP Tokens in Your Wallet
PLP tokens are typically liquidity provider (LP) tokens from a decentralized exchange like Uniswap or SushiSwap, representing your share of a liquidity pool. To locate them:

Check your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) or use a blockchain explorer like Etherscan.
Look for tokens with pair addresses or names like "Uniswap V2" that indicate they are LP tokens.
Step 2: Determine the Total Supply of PLP Tokens
The total supply is the total number of PLP tokens issued for that liquidity pool. To find it:

Method: Query the totalSupply() function on the PLP token’s smart contract.
Tools:
On-Chain: Use a library like Web3.js or ethers.js to call totalSupply().
Off-Chain: Visit Etherscan, go to the token’s contract page, and use the "Read Contract" section to view the total supply.
Step 3: Identify the Tokens in the Pair
Each PLP token corresponds to a pair of two tokens (e.g., Token A and Token B). To find them:

Method: Call the token0() and token1() functions on the pair contract to get the addresses of the two tokens.
Tools:
On-Chain: Use Web3.js or ethers.js to query the pair contract.
Off-Chain: On Etherscan, go to the pair contract’s "Read Contract" section and check token0() and token1().
Step 4: Calculate the Dollar Value of Each Side
To derive how much dollar value you have in each token of the pair, follow these steps:

a. Calculate Your Share of the Pool
Determine how many PLP tokens you hold (your balance).
Calculate your share of the pool:
text

Copy
Your Share = Your PLP Balance / Total Supply of PLP Tokens
b. Find the Reserves of Each Token
Call the getReserves() function on the pair contract to get the current reserves of Token A and Token B.
Multiply your share by the reserves to find your portion:
text

Copy
Your Amount of Token A = Your Share × Reserve of Token A
Your Amount of Token B = Your Share × Reserve of Token B
c. Get the Market Prices
Obtain the current dollar price of Token A and Token B using:
Price oracles (e.g., Chainlink).
APIs from services like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap.
DEX price feeds.
d. Calculate the Dollar Value
Multiply your amount of each token by its price:
text

Copy
Value of Token A = Your Amount of Token A × Price of Token A
Value of Token B = Your Amount of Token B × Price of Token B
The total value of your position is the sum of these two amounts.
Example
Let’s say:

You hold 100 PLP tokens.
The total supply is 1000 PLP tokens.
Reserves are 5000 Token A and 10,000 Token B.
Token A is $2 each, and Token B is $1 each.
Calculations:

Your share: 100 / 1000 = 0.1 (10% of the pool).
Your amount of Token A: 0.1 × 5000 = 500.
Your amount of Token B: 0.1 × 10,000 = 1000.
Value of Token A: 500 × $2 = $1000.
Value of Token B: 1000 × $1 = $1000.
Total value: $1000 + $1000 = $2000.
So, you have $1000 in Token A and $1000 in Token B.

Conclusion
Yes, you can absolutely find PLP tokens in your wallet, get the total supply, identify the tokens in the pair, and derive the dollar value of each side. You’ll just need access to blockchain data (via a wallet, explorer, or code) and current token prices. Let me know if you need help with any specific part!
